## Organization Overview

### What is Communitere?

**Full Name:** Communitere International (Communities United in Response, Relief & Renewal)

**Type:** Grassroots nonprofit disaster response and community resilience organization

**Founded:** 2010 (following 2004 Asian Tsunami response in Thailand)

**Founded By:** Sam Bloch (Executive Director and Founder)

**Geographic Presence:** Operates across three continents
- Haiti Communitere (primary/flagship)
- Philippines Communitere
- Nepal Communitere
- Greece Communitere
- Based in Lake Tahoe, USA

### Mission Statement

Communitere provides disaster response, relief, and renewal through community-centered, dignity-focused approaches that empower local people and groups to take active roles in the renewal and strengthening of their own communities.

### Core Belief

> "Communities are the best at meeting their own needs. It's also the most dignified. It's the most efficient, financially, time wise, everything."

---

## Founding Story & History

### The Genesis (2004 Tsunami - Thailand)

Sam Bloch began working in disaster relief after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami that devastated coastal Thailand. He led reconstruction efforts in the coastal village of Laem Pom, Thailand.

**Key Insight:** Bloch observed that traditional large international aid agencies (Red Cross, UN, etc.) parachuted in with predefined solutions without understanding local community needs or capabilities.

### The Problem Sam Identified

- Traditional disaster relief was inefficient and often patronizing
- Large NGOs approached recovery with imperialistic, colonial-minded assumptions
- Communities were treated as passive recipients rather than active agents
- Solutions imposed by outsiders often didn't match actual community needs
- Dignity and agency of survivors were not honored

### The Solution: Maker Spaces

Bloch joined forces with other volunteers to establish "maker spaces" - physical workshops where local people could:
- Design their own recovery plans
- Learn new skills using provided tools
- Build what they decided they needed (not what experts prescribed)
- Collaborate on prototypes and solutions to community-specific problems

### Evolution Through Disasters

**2004-2010:** Work in Thailand, Guatemala, Peru following earthquakes and disasters

**2010:** Haiti Earthquake - Communitere launches first brick-and-mortar Resource Center
- The Haiti center became the flagship model
- Still operating and thriving today
- Testament to community ownership and sustainability

**2011-2015:** Expansion to Philippines, Nepal, and Greece with similar models

**2020-Present:** COVID response, refugee support, climate resilience focus

---

## Core Philosophy & Values

### The "Spaces of Safe Failure" Concept

Communitere creates what they call "Spaces of Safe Failure" - resource centers where:
- Community members can experiment without fear of judgment
- Local inhabitants can build their own homes and solutions
- People can try new ideas and learn through doing
- Collaboration happens between survivors and supporters
- Creativity and autonomy are centered

### Pride in What We Don't Do

A core ethos: **"Pride in what we don't do"**

This means:
- Communitere doesn't impose solutions or take over projects
- The organization deliberately stays out of what communities can handle themselves
- The role is to enable, resource, and facilitate - not to execute
- Community agency and leadership are non-negotiable

### Dignity-First Approach

At the heart of Communitere's work is the principle that survivors deserve:
- Respect as decision-makers in their own recovery
- Agency to determine their own paths forward
- Recognition that they know their own needs best
- Opportunity to maintain creative control
- Integration of cultural values and local knowledge

### Key Value: Recovery as Renewal

Communitere's approach includes three stages:
1. **Response** - Immediate crisis support
2. **Relief** - Essential aid and resources
3. **Renewal** - Long-term community rebuilding and strengthening

The organization works toward comprehensive recovery that actually strengthens communities.

### Efficiency Through Community

The organization has observed that:
- Community-led solutions are financially more efficient
- Local action is faster than bureaucratic processes
- Time investment is more effective when communities lead
- Resource allocation is smarter when determined locally

---

## Operational Model

### Resource Centers (Brick & Mortar)

Communitere establishes regional resource centers in affected communities:

**Locations & Purpose:**
- Haiti Resource Center (since 2010, primary hub)
- Philippines Resource Center
- Nepal Resource Center
- Greece Resource Center

**What They Provide:**
- Physical workshop space filled with tools and materials
- Meeting spaces for community organizing
- Storage for medical supplies, equipment, and resources
- Training and skill-building opportunities
- Coordination hub for multiple organizations

**Impact (Haiti Example):**
- Serves 185+ community entities annually
- Connects thousands of people per year
- Documented uses include Haitian Sign Language training, COVID response, medical redistribution warehousing

### Service Model Examples

**Medical Redistribution Warehouse (Haiti):**
- Problem: Clinics received donated medical supplies they didn't need, while lacking critical supplies they did need
- Solution: Communitere provided space and coordination to redistribute supplies efficiently
- Result: Supplies went to places that actually needed them

**Disaster Housing Support:**
- After disasters, injured people are evacuated to capital cities
- Family members accompany them but have nowhere to stay
- Solution: Resource centers housed families during recovery period
- Result: Families could stay together, reducing trauma during recovery

**Helicopter Resource Coordination (COVID):**
- Multiple organizations operating in hard-to-reach areas during emergencies
- Solution: Central coordination hub for resource sharing
- Result: Efficient use of limited resources and capacity

### The "Community is Our Superpower" Framework

(Adapted from World Central Kitchen, where Sam Bloch now also works)

Instead of asking:
- "How will we solve this problem?"
- "What expertise do we bring?"
- "How do we mobilize our resources?"

Ask instead:
- "What community networks already exist?"
- "What resources and capacity do they have?"
- "What are they missing?"
- "How do we provide permission and resources to amplify what's already happening?"

## Key Partnerships & Network

### Burners Without Borders (BWB)

**Relationship:** Sister organization; significant partner and funder
**Connection:** Based on shared Burning Man cultural values

**Shared DNA:**
- Cultural-first approach to crisis response
- Bringing art, wonder, and joy to difficult situations
- Community empowerment through decentralized action
- Network effect multiplication

**BWB's Contribution:**
- Seed funding for Haiti Communitere (multiple $1,500-$5,000 grants over years)
- People power during deployments
- Network connections and resource partnerships
- Validation and support of the model

**Key Concept:** BWB's Philosophy
- "Response, Resilience, Regeneration"
- Focus on building communities ready for crisis (rather than just responding to each crisis)
- On a long timeline, every community will face disaster - so build resilience NOW
- Spin out partner organizations rather than running everything centrally

### World Central Kitchen (WCK)

**Relationship:** Sam Bloch (Communitere founder) now works with WCK

**Alignment:** Community-led disaster response model
- "Community is our superpower"
- Local network activation over external expertise
- Ukraine example: Found anarchist punk event producers with network, warehouses, trucks - became WCK's implementing arm
- Mozambique example: Local resources and people mobilized by single credit card and immediate action

### Fiscal Sponsorship Network

**Context:** Communitere is a founder/supporter of the fiscal sponsorship movement

**Significance:** Fiscal sponsors enable community projects to:
- Gain 501(c)(3) status without nonprofit overhead
- Access funding they couldn't otherwise receive
- Start without full organizational infrastructure
- Focus on work rather than bureaucracy

**Models Referenced:**
- Model A (Direct): All-in-one comprehensive sponsorship
- Model C (Indirect): Pre-approved grant relationship
- Tides Foundation: Major fiscal sponsor network

---

## Strategic Direction

### Current Pivot (2024-2025)

As articulated in November 2025 Board Meeting:

**From:** International long-term deployments
**To:** US-based community infrastructure building

**Why:**
- Rate of climate disasters increasing (no longer one big event, but constant impact)
- US communities (Vermont, California, etc.) facing severe climate impacts
- Institutional systems are destabilizing and failing
- Need for local resilience infrastructure in home country

### US Focus Areas

**Primary:** Building community capacity and networks to respond to local crises

**Example - Vermont:**
- Rivers flooding every July (due to historical clear-cutting and climate impacts)
- Farmers know exactly what infrastructure is needed
- Barrier: Lack of financial resources and capacity
- Solution: Connect farmers with resources, tools, and network support to solve their own problems

**Model:** Community-to-community connection rather than top-down intervention

### Mentorship & Capacity Building

Communitere team members are now positioned to:
- Mentor others into this work
- Share 20+ years of experience
- Support other organizations launching similar initiatives
- Build network effects through partnership

### Network Effect Strategy

Rather than running everything, Communitere is focusing on:
- **Spinning out** partner organizations that can take the model to their contexts
- **Connecting** organizations working on similar principles
- **Supporting** existing grassroots initiatives with resources and infrastructure
- **Multiplying** impact through network partnerships

**Examples of Successfully Spun-Out Organizations:**
- Sail Relief (Caribbean sailboat supply delivery)
- Grassroots Aid Partnership / Gap (kitchen deployments)
- Footprint Project (solar relief in disaster zones)
- Build Back Greener (disaster relief and climate action)

## Ecosystem Map Role

### Why the Ecosystem Map Matters

The ecosystem map serves as a **knowledge and network tool** to:

1. **Map Existing Assets**
   - Identify community organizations already working on mutual aid, resilience, community organizing
   - Locate fiscal sponsors enabling grassroots projects
   - Find maker spaces and DIY infrastructure
   - Identify resource centers and community hubs

2. **Enable Network Connection**
   - Help communities find partners and resources
   - Cross-pollinate best practices between initiatives
   - Identify organizations for potential spinning out or partnership
   - Show where network capacity already exists

3. **Identify Gaps**
   - See where community infrastructure is missing
   - Understand underserved regions and populations
   - Find opportunities to support or resource organizations

4. **Demonstrate Network Effect**
   - Make visible the interconnected nature of community organizing
   - Show how decentralized networks multiply impact
   - Illustrate partnerships and collaborations

### Who Uses It

- Communitere team seeking partners and learning opportunities
- Community organizers looking for resources and connections
- People seeking to understand the mutual aid / community organizing ecosystem
- Organizations considering partnership with Communitere
- Researchers and practitioners studying community resilience

### What It Should Include

Organizations and entities that:
- Operate in mutual aid / community organizing
- Support local resilience and community-led solutions
- Work with fiscal sponsorship or alternative organizational models
- Engage maker/DIY culture for problem-solving
- Focus on equity-centered community work
- Build local/regional networks
- Support disaster resilience and preparedness
- Empower communities to solve their own problems

## Related Concepts & Frameworks

### Mutual Aid (vs. Charity)

**Mutual Aid Principles:**
- Reciprocal exchange of resources and services
- Member-led, member-organized
- Non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic
- Consensus-based decision-making
- Egalitarian participation
- Community members control resources

**Historical Examples:**
- Black Panther Party food programs (1960s)
- AIDS crisis mutual aid networks (1980s-90s)
- Hurricane Katrina volunteer response (2005) - first crowdsourced disaster relief
- COVID-19 neighborhood mutual aid (2020)

**Key Difference from Charity:**
- Mutual aid: "We help each other"
- Charity: "We help them"

### The Maker Movement

**Origins:** Emerged ~2010 alongside Communitere, similar DNA

**Core Idea:**
- Smart people with tools can solve problems
- DIY and decentralized innovation
- Community workshops as innovation spaces
- Identity of "maker" = creative problem-solver

**Relevance to Communitere:**
- Resource centers function as maker spaces
- People design and build their own solutions
- Tools + space + community = innovation
- Maker Faire connected this to broader movement

### Community Organizing Principles

**Core Principle:** People most affected by problems are best positioned to solve them

**Key Elements:**
- Local leadership development
- Democratic decision-making
- Power-building through networks
- Connection of individual issues to systemic change
- Accountability to community members

### Cultural First Response

**Concept:** Disaster response doesn't have to be grim and utilitarian

**Integration of:**
- Art and beauty during crisis
- Celebration and joy alongside aid
- Cultural expression and connection
- Hope and possibility rather than doom
- Community gathering and ritual

**Burning Man Connection:** This ethos strongly present in BM culture - not frivolous, but deeply humanizing
